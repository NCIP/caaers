<!-- Individual Case Safety Report(s) Specifications -->
<!--
Entity ref:	A.1
Entity title:	SAFETY REPORT
Entity name:	safetyreport
Comment :	The following fields are specific to the Report and should be considered as a Report Header: safetyreportid, safetyreportversion, transmissiondateformat, transmissiondate, receivedateformat, receivedate, sender, receiver. A Sender may change the contents of these fields without altering the contents of the Report associated to a Case. In this case, the Sender acts as a Relay.
Comment :	Any change in the other fields generates a new Report. The Sender acts as an Author.
Comment :	At present, there is no way to identify when the Sender acts as Relay or as Author, the ReceiptDate being insufficient for this purpose. This would require that the Sender would highlight the fields added, deleted or modified from a Report they received. This function was discussed by the ICH M2 EWG and may be introduced in the future as part of the message specification. The Receiver must compare subsequent Reports within one thread and between threads.
Comment :	The relational model of the Safety Report is described in the following figure:



Comment :	One and only one of the following fields should be populated:
A.1.10.1 - National regulatory authority's case report number
A.1.10.2 -  Company's case report number
A.1.10.3 - Other sender's case report number
Comment :	While the Case Number (A.1.10) is used to identify a Case and is fixed by the Case Author, the Report Identifier is used to facilitate the communication between two correspondents: Sender and Receiver. Being the safetyreportid and safetyreportversion optional fields, the Sender may choose among the following identification policies:
a.- not to specify safetyreportid. In this case, the reference to the report is done on the basis of the messagenumber and the position of the Report in the Message (the third report in the message. The acknowledgement will follow this identification policy).
b.- to specify the Report Number (safetyreportid) but not to specify the Report Version (safetyreportversion). The Report Number is the number given by the Sender to the report, as opposed to the Case Number, given by the original Case author. As indicated by the ICH E2B EWG, the ReceiptDate may be used to locate the report in the sequence of follow-ups related to a Case, or more specifically to a Thread.
c.- to specify the Report Number (safetyreportid) and the Report Version (safetyreportversion). This may be done by Case authors not interested in keeping the historic but interested in keeping track of the number of follow-ups transmitted.
Comment :	A possible flow of reports is described in the following picture. The fact that the Case Number (CN) remains the same makes it possible to recognise that the three reports respond to the same Case (MN: message number, RN: report number, LRN: Local Report Number, CN: case number).

Entity ref:	A.3.1
Entity title:	SENDER
Entity name:	sender
Comment :	It has been discussed if Sender refers to the first sender or to the last sender.
The reasons in favour of being the first sender include the following:
-the sender is already indicated at the message header level. -the additional administrative information should be available in the data base of addresses of the receiver.
-the sender block does not allow for a coded value: sender id identification required for controlled transmission of safety reports.
-if the sender is the last sender, this require consistency checking for all the reports in one message.
The reasons in favour of being the last sender include the following:
-there may be difference correspondents within the same sender organisation for difference reports.
-spontaneous reporting may be done by non-registered correspondents.

The contents of A.1.10.1 or A.1.10.2 should be populated only once, and all of these three items should remain unchanged for any transmissions subsequent to the original transmission. That is to say, these fields must only be populated once by the originator of the first transmission. Companies or other organisations should ensure a single international report number (A.1.10.2) to facilitate the unique identification of a report that may have been sent to many places and subject to multiple transmissions. The contents of the fields A.1.10.1 and/or A.1.10.2 should first list A.1.1 - Identification of the country of primary source and secondly list A.3.1.2 - Sender Identifier, Sender Organization, and lastly, the company international case report number, delimited by hyphens.

For example, a report transmitted by a US company to a regulatory authority would populate A.1.10.2 with "US-Company Name-12345", where "12345" is the company's unique case report number. In the event that the regulatory authority transmitted this ICSR to another regulatory authority, A.1.10.2 would remain the same. The regulatory authority would not populate A.1.10.1.

If the situation occurs where multiple reports are received about the same case, such as a report from a physician and a report from another company, the information may be merged. One number will be maintained as the case number in its original field and the second number will be listed as a suspected duplicate.
